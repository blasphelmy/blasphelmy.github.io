            <p>
                I'm from a first generation family of immigrants. My parents had me in Vietnam and we moved 
                here when I was really young. We did struggle a lot but we've managed to do alright for ourselves. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It would be an understatement to say that I was a little lost after graduating high school. I
                didn't really know what I wanted to do with myself or what any of my future plans are. But after being part
                of life for a few years, I decided I wanted to go back into school, and since then I've been working really hard
                on all of my classes. I've come to recognize the opportunities and privileges that I have and are available
                to me, and I aim to make the most of that.
            </p>

            <p class="pHeaders">- Renton Technical College</p>
            <p>
                Currently a second year student at Renton Technical College working on my Associates degree, which I expect to earn this spring. Moving
                forward after that, I will also be working towards my Bachelor's here at RTC.
            </p>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p class="pHeaders">Graduate College with a Bachelor's at the very least</p>
            <p class="pHeaders">Pursue an internship in Web Development</p>
            <p class="pHeaders">Pursue a future career in Web Development</p>
            <p>
                Working here has given me the opportunity to really develop not only my skills and understanding of computer science,
                it has also helped me develop my communication skills. While sitting there and learning how to effectively communicate CompSci concepts 
                to a student who may have come in not understanding anything at all, is definitely an ongoing process, I feel like in my time tutoring, I have figured it out enough
                to help those type of students make significant progress in their learning here at RTC.
            </p>

                Current Future Prospects

            <p>
                Next quarter, depending on how things go, I'm also expected to start a new Teaching Assistant Job position for
                CSI 242, which is an Intro to Javascripting class. It's the one I am/have already taken this quarter and have thoroughly
                enjoyed.

            <p>
                Built a website for myself and my photography back in high school. Its no longer available online unfortunately or do I have a copy of it. 
                But it was basically a website made from HTML/CSS/PHP.

            <p class="pHeaders">- Built a Custom Map for Call of Duty (HS)</p>
            <p>
                I've also created a custom zombies map for the video game Call of Duty using the developer tools. Last time I checked, which 
                was a few years ago, it had over 50,000 downloads. I think it only ever got that popular because it ended up being featured on a very popular
                youtube channel, dedicated to Call of Duty Zombies. Don't ask me what the map is called so you can look it up, it's embarrassingly awful.

                This is a javascript visualizer. It breaks down basic javascript, then it parses it and saves the output 
                of the javascript into a tree that we can display.
